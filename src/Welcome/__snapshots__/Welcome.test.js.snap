            This is an organizational tool to setup minimal, static, black & white, sketch-like wireframes as a representation of your GitHub issue and project cards. By pairing wireframe elements to GitHub issues in a Repository & Project of your choosing, you can filter your features and GitHub cards based on completion status to see your feature progress in relation to all your features - the end goal!
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool is intended for small teams, who desire simple and no-fuss wireframes where keeping track of feature completion is the highest priority in team communication.
